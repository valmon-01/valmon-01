## About

Business Administration graduate with experience in consulting, KPI management and data analysis.

My professional foundation is rooted in understanding how organizations make decisions. Over time, my interest evolved toward understanding how digital products are actually built.

## Learning Philosophy

I use AI-assisted development tools to accelerate prototyping and deepen my understanding of system design, data flow and technical trade-offs. My objective is not simply to generate code, but to understand the reasoning behind architectural decisions and build with intention.
